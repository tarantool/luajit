/*
 * This test demonstrates LuaJIT's incorrect behaviour on
 * loading Lua chunk with cdata numbers.
 * See https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT/issues/1168 for details.
 *
 * The GC is driving forward during parsing of the Lua chunk
 * (`test_chunk`). The chunk contains a single cdata object with
 * a number. That leads to the opening of the FFI library
 * on-demand during the parsing of this number. After the FFI
 * library is open, `ffi.gc` has the finalizer table as its
 * environment. But, there is no FFI module table anywhere to
 * anchor the `ffi.gc` itself, and the `lua_State` object is
 * marked after the function is removed from it. Hence, after the
 * atomic phase, the table is considered dead and collected. Since
 * the table is collected, the usage of its nodes in the
 * `lj_gc_finalize_cdata` leads to heap-use-after-free.
