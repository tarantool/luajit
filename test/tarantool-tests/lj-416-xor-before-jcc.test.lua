-- To reproduce this issue, we need:
-- 0) IR for either "internal" (e.g. type check, hmask check) or "external"
--    (e.g. branch or loop condition) guard begins to be emitted to
--    mcode.
-- 1) JCC to side exit is emitted to the trace mcode at the beginning.
-- 2) Condition (i.e. comparison) is going to be emitted.
-- 3) Fuse optimization takes its place, that ought to allocate a register
--    for the load base.
-- 4) There are no free registers at this point.
-- 5) The one storing the constant zero is chosen to be sacrificed and
--    reallocated (consider the allocation cost in ra_alloc for constant
--    materialization).
-- 6) Before (or in the sense of trace execution, after) register is
--    being used in the aforementioned comparison, register (r14 in our
--    case) is reset by XOR emitted right after (before) jump instruction.
-- 7) The comparison with fused load within is emitted.
--
-- This leads to assembly code like the following:
--   ucomisd xmm7, [r14]
--   xor r14d, r14d
--   jnb 0x555d3d250014        ->1
--
-- That xor is a big problem, as it modifies flags between the
-- ucomisd and the jnb, thereby causing the jnb to do the wrong
-- thing.
