  # since some programs sanitize the environment before they start
  # child processes. Specifically, environment variables starting

  # test suite). For more info, see the docs[2] below.

  # These environment variables are used by FFI machinery to find
  # the proper shared library, hence we can still tweak testing
  # environment before calling <ffi.load>. However, the value
  # can't be passed via the standard environment variable, so we
  # use env call in prove's --exec flag value to get around SIP
  # magic tricks.
